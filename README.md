# Onboarding
Welcome to the PhD program!
Here are a few resources that you will hopefully find useful.

## Computational Resources
### High Performance Computing
Cranfield's supercomputer for researchers is Delta.
Before accessing it you will need to fill and submit this
  [form](https://intranet.cranfield.ac.uk/it/Documents3/DeltaApplication.pdf)
  to IT.
The official documentation can be found
  [here](https://intranet.cranfield.ac.uk/it/Documents3/Getting%20Started%20With%20HPC.pdf).

Hint: stick this command, where s000000 is your student number, in a bash script
  to make accessing the system easier.
``` bash
ssh -t s000000@hpcgate.cranfield.ac.uk ssh s000000@delta.central.cranfield.ac.uk
```
